# Discourse Notifications

A Firefox add-on which helpfully displays notifications from the Discourse instance(s) you're logged into.

## Installation

Download the latest version from [the releases](https://github.com/LeoMcA/firefox-discourse-notifications/releases) page.

This is pre-release software. Please use with caution. **You have been warned.**

Your browser might eat your RAM or your computer might burst into flames.

### Reporting Issues

If your browser does start eating your RAM (or if anything else seems a little... off) you should [report a bug](https://github.com/LeoMcA/firefox-discourse-notifications/issues/new?labels=bug).

<small>(However, if your computer bursts into flames you should probably call the Fire Brigade.)</small>

## Development

This add-on uses the [Mozilla Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).

I recommend you use the [jpm tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm) for development.
